# Todo Application

## Overview

This To-Do List application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The application allows users to create, edit, and delete to-do items, attach voice notes to tasks, and search through their tasks easily. The front end is built using React with TypeScript, and it uses Material UI for styling. For data fetching and state management, TanStack Query and Axios are utilized. A JSON server is used as a fake backend for storing data.
